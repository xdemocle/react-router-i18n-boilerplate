# AI Task: Migrate Features & Code Safely

## üõ†Ô∏è Task: Migrate Features & Code Safely

Migrate all relevant features and code changes from the following source project to the new one.

**Source Project:**  
`/Users/democle/Documents/TheWeb3Ninja/react-router-i18n-boilerplate`

**Destination Project:**  
`/Users/democle/Documents/TheWeb3Ninja/bzz-one-app`

---

### ‚úÖ Requirements

1. Analyze both codebases **before** making any changes.
2. Transfer only meaningful changes (new features, improvements, updated logic).
3. **Do not overwrite** sensitive or project-specific data.
   - ‚ùå Do not overwrite `./public/locales`
   - ‚úÖ Merge missing translations without deleting existing content.
4. Respect local `.windsurfrules` and any memory/metadata files.
5. Pause and ask only if something _critical_ remains ambiguous **after** the initial strategy.

---

### üß† Step 1: Initial Analysis

You‚Äôve already begun examining the projects. Here's your current progress:

```plaintext
‚úÖ Analyzed: ~/Documents/TheWeb3Ninja/react-router-i18n-boilerplate
‚úÖ Analyzed: ~/Documents/TheWeb3Ninja/bzz-one-app
‚úÖ Analyzed app/ directory structure for both
```

---

### üîé Key Findings from Analysis

You've already gathered the following insights:

- Both projects use **i18n**. The destination has more translation files (32 vs 8).
- Destination uses **Shadcn UI** (`components.json`). The source does not.
- Both projects have **test setups**.
- Source project has **Vite/Vitest-specific configs** that may be optimized for performance.
- Destination has more **components** (25 vs 13) and **routes** (6 vs 3).

---

### ü§ñ Claude, Proceed With These Assumptions

- ‚úÖ Merge i18n translation keys from the source **into** destination without overwriting.
- ‚úÖ Keep **Shadcn UI** styling from the destination intact. Only port functional components.
- ‚úÖ Merge relevant **test cases** where they add value or improve coverage.
- ‚úÖ Review Vite and Vitest configs. Merge only if beneficial and not conflicting.
- ‚úÖ Maintain the routing and structure of the destination, but integrate useful patterns from the source where applicable.

---

### üìå Step 2: Migration Strategy

Now, based on your analysis, Claude should:

- Identify **new features** in the source that don't exist in the destination.
- Propose a **merge plan** as YAML:

```yaml
files_to_copy: [...]
files_to_merge: [./public/locales, src/tests/...]
files_to_skip: [.env.local, shadcn-ui components, .gitignore]
special_handling:
  - ./public/locales: merge_missing_keys
  - .env.local: preserve destination-specific data
  - vite.config.ts: conditional merge (performance only)
  - routing: maintain destination structure, integrate only new patterns
```

**‚è∏Ô∏è Action:**
Stop here and wait for the user to approve the proposed strategy before applying any changes.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: Execute Migration

Once approved:

- Apply the strategy step by step.
- Keep the destination structure intact.
- Log every change made.

---

### üßæ Step 4: Summary Output

After execution, provide a summary like:

```diff
+ Added src/hooks/useCustomI18n.ts
~ Merged i18n/en/common.json (added 6 keys)
~ Updated vite.config.ts with improved chunking strategy
- Skipped overwrite of .env.local
```

---

### üîß Optional (Ask After Migration)

Would you like to enable any of the following?

- [ ] Auto-format updated files with Prettier or ESLint
- [ ] Generate a changelog or commit message
- [ ] Suggest new test cases
- [ ] Identify unused code or dead files

---

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Always default to **merge, not overwrite**. When unsure, favor preserving the destination project.
